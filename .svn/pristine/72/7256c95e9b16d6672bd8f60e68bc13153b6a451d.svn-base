Schedule 6 Audit Policies
1.
2.
2.1
2.2

2.3
3.
3.1

Purpose
The purpose of this Schedule (Audit Policies) is to define the technical audit activities (and requirements associated therewith) which SCB or Supplier are entitled to carry out or
to procure in respect of the provision of the Services.
Scope
This Schedule (Audit Policies) relates to the auditing of Supplier's use of computer hardware, software and other resources to deliver the Services.
An audit of Supplier's use of computer hardware, software and other resources used to deliver the Services must be conducted annually by Supplier's internal auditors (Supplier
IA) to assess the risk and control environment and compliance with generally accepted standards for the operation of IT with specific focus on compliance with:
(a)    regulatory and legal requirements;
(b)    data protection legislation;
{c)    adherence to requirements stated in this Agreement;
{d)    accuracy of resource consumption data as used in billing;
{e) achievement of performance standards;
{I) Supplier's internal operating policies and procedures; and (g) any other SCB operating policies and procedures to the extent set out in this
agreement or as may be notified from time to time by SCB in writing to Supplier.
Any work which is required by SCB to be carried out by Supplier after the date of execution of this Agreement and which is necessary to ensure compliance with any changes to the requirements listed in paragraphs (a) to (g) above must be processed and implemented in accordance with the agreed change control procedures, provided that ii any such work would not result in Supplier incurring any additional cost then Supplier will undertake the work as directed by SCB at Supplier's own cost.
Audits will also check that the agreed process for reporting regulatory and compliance problems has been adequately followed.
Supplier's Internal Audit
In order to comply with the operating policies and procedures under which SCB operates,
Supplier must maintain an effective internal control environment. This will include the operation of an internal audit function. Supplier must ensure that:
(a)    Supplier IA staff have suitable skills, qualifications and experience;
(b) Supplier IA staff have access to such Supplier personnel, documentation, relevant records and other information required for the purpose of completing the audits; and
(c) Supplier IA team have the organisational status and the objectivity required to undertake independent audits.
3.2 SCB will have the right to escalate issues to a committee of two or more representatives consisting of a minimum of one representative from each party to this Agreement, (the 'Joint Executive Committee'), who will have the authority to resolve any ongoing dispute SCB may have with the Supplier where:
(a) evidence is found that the resource within Supplier IA is not sufficient to deliver the contractual obligations described in this Schedule (Audit Policies); and
(b) evidence and results, or subsequent feedback, indicate that Supplier IA staff are not suitably qualified, or if the audit carried out is not of appropriate quality.
The Joint Executive Committee may require further actions to be performed including the re-conducting of an audit if either of (a) and (b) above is found to be the case.
3.3    The Joint Executive Committee will initially comprise:
(i)    one representative from SCB; and
(ii)    one representative from Supplier.
3.4 Each party will notify the other of the name and contact details of their representative of the Joint Executive Committee on or before the date of this Agreement.
3.5    If a party wishes to replace its representative on the Joint Executive Committee, both parties
will consult with one another and use their best endeavours to agree on the individual to be the replacement member of the Joint Executive Committee.
3.6 Supplier is not required to obtain a third party review or external audit as an obligation under this Schedule 6 (Audit Policies).
3.7    If SCB is dissatisfied with any aspect of an audit carried out by Supplier it will be entitled,
at its own cost, to conduct a reasonable audit of the areas in relation to which it has concerns and Supplier must co-operate fully with SCB's audit.
4. Regulatory Requirements
4.1 In the financial services industry it is common for regulatory bodies to impose new, or changes to existing, regulations or standards which impact the design of control systems and the application of internal control. Should such changes in regulations or standards be specified by the regulatory bodies, SCB must decide whether any consequential change to this Agreement is required.
4.2 Any such change following the Effective Date must be processed and implemented by the application of the agreed change control procedures. Upon completion of the change control procedures, Supplier will work with SCB to implement any changes (approved as part of the change control procedures) within the agreed time frames indicated by the regulatory bodies. Following the implementation of the change control procedures, Supplier must implement any systems changes necessary to meet these requirements
and allow reasonable inspection of its services/premises used to provide the Services from time to time if legally required by such regulatory bodies.
4.3 SCB must communicate to Supplier in writing such regulatory changes of which it becomes aware and which it requires to be implemented. A written communication, if sent to Supplier notifying Supplier of a regulatory change, shall be deemed to be a notification of a request by SCB for implementation of that regulatory change.
5. Costs
5.1    The implementation of any audit findings relating to provision of the Services (including but
not limited to any computer hardware, computer software, processes or services included within the scope of this Agreement) found by Supplier IA will be implemented at Supplier's own cost. Any audit findings and required changes which alter the scope of the Services will be processed and implemented by the application of the change control procedures.
5.2    In respect of any audit findings by any third party, a report must be prepared of the findings
of such audit and discussed with SCB's internal audit personnel (SCB IA). If necessary, these findings must be submitted to the next meeting of the Joint Executive Committee. If the Joint Executive Committee considers that the findings highlight critical problems associated with Supplier's provision of the Services, [the Joint Executive Committee] must agree an action plan (including a timetable) for remedying defects found, and must agree the implementation costs to be borne by the parties.
5.3 The costs of audits of the provision of the Services undertaken by Supplier IA must be borne by Supplier.
6. External Audits
6.1 Copies of extracts from any external audit reports showing all (non-commercially confidential) items directly relating to the Services or this Schedule (Audit Policies) are to be provided to SCB IA within 30 days of receipt by Supplier.
6.2 SCB IA will, at any time, on reasonable notice and not more than once in any twelve month period, also have the right to undertake an audit of Supplier's provision of the Services as described in this Schedule (Audit Policies). Supplier must ensure that SCB
IA have unrestricted access to Supplier staff, documentation, relevant records and other information required for the purpose of completing the audit (but excluding information and records relating to Supplier's internal costs and margins for the Services), provided that the SCB IA members are either personnel of SCB or are approved by Supplier, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Those SCB IA members requiring approval from Supplier and who have been so approved, must sign a non-disclosure agreement in a reasonable form approved by Supplier and must otherwise comply with Supplier's reasonable security requirements. Notwithstanding the notice and frequency restrictions contained within this paragraph, should SCB reasonably suspect that there is a material breach of system security or of the security if the Services then SCB may immediately notify Supplier of the grounds for its suspicion and, upon such notification having been given, SCB will have the right to undertake an immediate audit.
6.3 Supplier's provision of the Services may also be subject to periodic audits by SCB's external auditors or regulators, including but not limited to the FSA, Hong Kong Monetary
Authority or any equivalent agency in any Country, and Supplier must and must procure that where necessary all subcontractors provide all necessary assistance and co-operation in connection with such audits. Each party will bear its own costs in relation to any such audit.
6.4 SCB IA must not unduly interfere with Supplier's ability to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and, to the extent of any such undue interference, Supplier will be relieved from performing its corresponding obligations under this Agreement.
7. Supplier Audit Process 7 .1    Supplier Internal Audit Calendar
Supplier will provide to SCB IA an internal audit calendar no later than 60 days prior to the commencement of each audit year. The calendar will outline all the audit activities for the year.
7.2 Supplier Audit Planning
In respect of each audit, SCB IA must on a timely basis be provided with copies of, and reserves the right to provide input into, the following:
(a)    Risk identification and weighting assessment;
(b}    Terms of reference;
(c}    Scope and coverage;
(d)    Audit programme; and
(e} Key dates, including:
(i) Commencement of the audit;
(ii) Commencement of fieldwork;
(iii)    Completion of fieldwork;
(iv}    Written audit findings;
(v)    Obtaining management responses;
(vi} Issue of draft report; and
(vii) Issue of completed report.
The timing and location of these reviews will normally be agreed at the outset of the audit.
7.3 Implementation of Recommendations
Subject as stated below, Supplier will comply with any audit recommendations arising from:
(a} any Supplier internal audit of Supplier's provision of the Services; and (b}    any external audit of Supplier's provision of the Services; and
(c) any SCB audit of Supplier's provision of the Services,
applying, where required by this Schedule 6 (Audit Policies) or as is otherwise appropriate, the agreed change control procedures.
7.4 Issues Tracking
SCB IA will be provided with quarterly updates on the status of the implementation of recommendations. Supplier IA will establish an effective issue tracking process to ensure that recommendations are implemented in accordance with agreed time-scales.

This code will be allocated if the receiving machine has responded stating that it HAS RECEIVED the imaae.


Note: Xpedite reports are mapped from gammafax codes, which are the errors that XDDS received - these codes are raw before they are interpreted. The codes may come from the remote fax machine, an intermediate Carrier, a local or remote Carrier, depending on where the error Is encountered. Wherever the error originates, it is transferred back to Xpedite's local Carrier prior to transmission to XDDS. The mapping from these codes to Xpedite is done on a 1 to 1 basis.
Also, since errors could be encountered at any point during the fax transmission attempt, and since Xpedite do not have direct control over which routes Carriers use, there Is no guarantee of 100% consistency !n the error codes that are reported.

Introduction
This document focuses on the initiatives relating to Virus control and security/update patching on XDDS Production Network in SEA.
These are the 3 core solutions we use to fight viruses. We also have formal I.T. Security
Policies, which cover threats to our internal network. The combination of our policies and the technical solutions we have put in place have resulted in O attacks/infiltrations on our Production network across the SEA region.
Background
Xpedite recognises that client traffic should be separated from the internal network. We have 2 dedicated networks, the Xpedite Production Network and the Internal Network. These networks are on different subnets/VLANs and are separated by a firewall. This method allows any internal/staff based outbreaks to stay segmented away from the Production Network. Please see "Virus Control and System Patching Policies for Xpedite SEA" for further details of Xpedite's internal (non production) network virus protection policy.
Incoming and Outgoing Job Control
All incoming and outgoing client jobs are screened at the point of entry by virus scanning software. All virus software signatures are kept up to date via automated daily updates(with the ability to 'push' an update if need be). The virus scanning software itself is kept up to date with the industry standard versions.
The Xpedite production network operates on multiple tiers. Each of these tiers runs a different virus scanning application under the ethos that the spectrum covered by a variety of applications will provide a better safeguard for our entire environment.
Package/Systein Update Services
All machines are configured on installation into the network, to be stand alone machines. This is to keep a constant operating system. Our Development team is subscribed to MS updates, as well as various
other security sites to keep a watch on any new potential tlueats. They then write a customised package or test MS patches in our test environment before pushing them onto the production network. From potential outbreak to World Wide coverage, this time taken is less then a day.
Network Segregation/ IP Range
As mentioned above, the Xpedite production network is segmented from the internal network. This actually extends one step further, to being a totally isolated network. Clients access XDDS via Xpedite's DMZ. The Xpedite production network in SEA uses a CIDR Class A private network. These methods ensure no production traffic ever reaches the outside world and removes the possibility of any intrusions into the production network.
