<p><span class="font3">The purpose of this Schedule </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Audit Policies) </span><span class="font3">is to define the technical audit activities (and requirements associated therewith) which SCB or Supplier are entitled to carry&nbsp;out or to procure in respect of the provision of the services under this Agreement</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">('Services').</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Scope</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2.1 This Schedule </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Audit Policies) </span><span class="font3">relates to the auditing of Supplier's use of computer&nbsp;hardware, software and other resources to deliver the Services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An audit of Supplier's use of computer hardware, software and other resources used to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">deliver the Services must be conducted annually by Supplier's internal auditors </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Supplier IA) </span><span class="font3">to assess the risk and control environment and compliance with&nbsp;generally accepted standards for the operation of IT with specific focus on compliance&nbsp;with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulatory and legal requirements;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data protection legislation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adherence to requirements stated in this Agreement;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accuracy of resource consumption data as used in billing;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achievement of Performance Standards;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(<sub>f</sub>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplier's internal operating policies and procedures; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other SCB operating policies and procedures to the extent set out in this</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">agreement or as may be notified from time to time by SCB in writing to Supplier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any work which is required by SCB to be carried out by Supplier after the date of execution of this Agreement and which is necessary to ensure compliance with any&nbsp;changes to the requirements listed in paragraphs (a) to (g) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">above</span><span class="font3"> must be processed&nbsp;and implemented in accordance with the agreed change control procedures, provided&nbsp;that if any such work would not result in Supplier incurring substantial additional cost&nbsp;then Supplier will undertake the work as directed by SCB at Supplier's own cost.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">3. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Supplier's Internal Audit</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3.1 In order to comply with the operating policies and procedures under which SCB&nbsp;operates, Supplier must maintain an effective internal control environment. This will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">include the operation of an internal audit function. Supplier must ensure that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">(a) </span><span class="font3">Supplier IA staff have suitable skills, qualifications and experience;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">(b) </span><span class="font3">Supplier IA staff have access to such Supplier personnel, documentation,&nbsp;relevant records and other information required for the purpose of completing&nbsp;the audits; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplier IA team have the organisational status and the objectivity required to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">undertake independent audits.</span></p><img src="1.0 Thunderhead_Software Licence Agreement_files/1.0 Thunderhead_Software Licence Agreement-10.jpg" style="width:50pt;height:53pt;"/>
<p><span class="font4">3.2 SCB will have the right to escalate issues to a committee of two or more&nbsp;representatives consisting of a minimum of one representative from each party to this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Agreement, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(the 'Joint Executive Committee'), </span><span class="font4">who will have the authority </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> resolve any ongoing dispute SCB may have with the Supplier where:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) evidence is found that the resource within Supplier IA is not sufficient to deliver&nbsp;the contractual obligations described in this Schedule </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Audit Policies); </span><span class="font4">and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(b) evidence and results, or subsequent feedback, indicate that Supplier IA staff&nbsp;are not suitably qualified, or if the audit carried out is not of appropriate quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Joint Executive Committee may require further actions to be performed including the re-conducting of an audit if either of (a) and (b) above is found to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3.3 The Joint Executive Committee will initially comprise:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one representative from SCB; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one representative from Supplier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party will notify the other of the name and contact details of their representative</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of the Joint Executive Committee on or before the date of this Agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3.5 If a party wishes to replace its representative on the Joint Executive Committee, both&nbsp;parties will consult with one another and use their best endeavours to agree on the&nbsp;individual to be the replacement member of the Joint Executive Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3.6 Supplier is not required to obtain a third party review or external audit as an obligation&nbsp;under this Schedule </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Audit Policies).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SCB is dissatisfied with any aspect of an audit carried out by Supplier it will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">entitled, at its own cost, to conduct an audit of the areas in relation to which it has concerns and Supplier must co-operate fully with SCB's audit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Regulatory Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4.1 In the financial services industry it is common for regulatory bodies to impose new, or&nbsp;changes to existing, regulations or standards which impact the design of control&nbsp;systems and the application of internal control. Should such changes in regulations or&nbsp;standards be specified by the regulatory bodies, SCB must decide whether any&nbsp;consequential change to this Agreement is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4.2 Any such change following the Effective Date must be processed and implemented by&nbsp;the application of the agreed change control procedures. Upon completion of the&nbsp;change control procedures, Supplier will work with SCB to implement any changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(approved as part of the change control procedures) within the agreed lime frames indicated by the regulatory bodies. Following the implementation of the change control&nbsp;procedures, Supplier must implement any systems changes necessary to meet these&nbsp;requirements and allow reasonable inspection of its services/premises used to provide&nbsp;the Services from time to time if legally required by such regulatory bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4.3 SCB must communicate to Supplier in writing such regulatory changes of which it&nbsp;becomes aware and which it requires to be implemented. A written communication, if&nbsp;sent to Supplier notifying Supplier of a regulatory change, shall be deemed to be a&nbsp;notification of a request by SCB for implementation of that regulatory change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Costs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of any audit findings relating to provision of the Services (including</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">but not limited to any computer hardware, computer software, processes or services included within the scope of this Agreement) found by Supplier IA will be implemented&nbsp;at Supplier's own cost. Any audit findings and required changes which alter the scope&nbsp;of the Services will be processed and implemented by the application of the change&nbsp;control procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5.2 In respect of any audit findings by any third party, a report must be prepared of the&nbsp;findings of such audit and discussed with SCB's internal audit personnel (SCB </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IA). </span><span class="font3">If&nbsp;necessary, these findings must be submitted to the next meeting of the Joint Executive&nbsp;Committee. If the Joint Executive Committee considers that the findings highlight&nbsp;critical problems associated with Supplier's provision of the Services, the Joint&nbsp;Executive Committee must agree an action plan (including a timetable) for remedying&nbsp;defects found, and must agree the implementation costs to be borne by the parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of audits of the provision of the Services undertaken by Supplier IA must be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">borne by Supplier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">6. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">External Audits</span></p>
