Schedule 1
Licence
Software
1. Licensed Software. The Supplier is licensing to SCB and SCB Group the following computer software components comprising the Software:
Computer Assisted Collection System (CACS®) ("CACS Enterprise") version 8.1.1 with CACS Recovery Accounting Subsystem ("GAS") (version 1 .1. 1) functionality
activated, and the Mainframe DB2 version comprised of either a Mainframe Component or Distributed Component ("Core Processing Software"), depending upon the operating platform appropriate for the version specified previously, and a MidTier Component ("MidTier Software") (collectively known as the "Software"). GAS is currently only available on the Mainframe platform.
The Supplier is licensing the Software source code to SCB and SCB Group. SCB may use the source code only to maintain and enhance the Software and for no other _pur_pose....The SupplieLis providing.Jo. sca-one-(1} copy. of the-Software on-machine-readable media and one copy of the source code for the Core Processing Software.
MidTier Software is the software that sits on the servers between the GUI front-end work station and the back-end mainframe or UNIX servers. The code is designed to provide functionality to support the GUI. All the business logic is basically on the back-end machine. So for example, the mid-tier will control the tables and information for the drop-down boxes in the GUI. This optimises the performance of the system and minimizes interaction with the back-end. The software was developed by CGI and is not customizable by the client. The client still has the ability to design GUI screens which is achieved through using standard facilities in CACS 8.1.1.
2. Software Breakdown.    The following breakdown represents the software
components and the percentages that each component comprises of the Software.
CACS Enterprise
Core Functionality    0.15
Enhanced Functionality    0.85
This breakdown is set out for the Supplier internal reasons only. It does not impact the licence granted to SCB for the Software.
3. Term of License. The term of this license shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement and continue for a period of thirty (30) years with an option to renew for an additional thirty 30 years by a one-time payment of a sum of USD$100,000 at
the time the renewal option is exercised.
