<p><span class="font10">Assume quarterly scores for the year are QTR 1 = -2.30, QTR 2 =-3.0, QTR 3 = -3.0 &amp; QTR 4 =-2.30 Average score for the year of Subscription = -2.65. Therefore assuming yearly Subscription&nbsp;amount = USD 726,000 the resultant additional amount due to Supplier —10% of USD 726,000 =&nbsp;USD-72,600 i.e. Supplier needs to refund SCB USD72,600.1139</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Refund Mechanism</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For refunds due to SCB as a result of this scorecard, (a) the monies should be set off against future payments (not restricted to payments for this Service); and (b) in the eve nt that there is&nbsp;no future payment, i.e. contract has been terminated, Supplier would have to refund the&nbsp;monies back to SCB in cash within 30 days.</span></p>
