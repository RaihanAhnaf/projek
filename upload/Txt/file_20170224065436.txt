24.3 Insurance

(c) Upon request from SCB the Supplier will produce to SCB adequate proof of insurance cover in respect of its liability under this Agreement (save where Supplier decides to self insure) which shall include a certificate of insurance.
24.4 Withholding Tax
(a) In the event that any payment to be made in respect of any invoice is subject by law to any withholding tax, the payer shall make payment to the payee of the amount owing, less a deduction for such withholding tax and shall account to the relevant tax authority for the withholding tax. Provided always that the payer has possession, as furnished by the payee, of declaration(s) of tax residence on the prescribed forms and certification of the Singapore (or other as relevant) taxation authorities which are current and accurate in order to confirm the applicability and availability of any reduced rate of withholding tax under the provisions of the relevant double taxation convention and/or treaty, the amount of withholding tax deducted will be calculated by the payer in accordance with any appropriate double taxation convention and/or treaty between the states in which the payer and the payee respectively reside. The payee shall furnish declaration(s) of tax residence on the prescribed forms and obtain certification of the Singapore (or other as relevant) taxation authorities in order that the payer may confirm the applicability and availability of any reduced rate of withholding tax under the provisions of the relevant double taxation convention and/or treaty as envisaged above.

Where the payer is not able to obtain such evidence (having used reasonable endeavours), the payer will provide written confirmation itself to the payee of the payment of said withholding tax.
24.5 Force Majeure
If either party fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control including but not limited to war, fire, blockade, strikes (excluding strikes by its own personnel) or natural catastrophe, then that party shall not be held responsible for any loss or damage which may be incurred by the other party as a result of such failure provided that, if the performance by the Supplier of its duties is substantially prevented for a continuous period of [fifteen] days (or more than [fifteen] separate days in any period of [thirty] days), SCB may, on thirty days written notice, terminate this Agreement or any part affected by such cause. Each party will give notice to the other as soon as possible upon becoming aware of an event that may lead to the invocation of this Clause.
24.6 Relationship
Nothing in this Agreement creates a joint venture, relationship of partnership or agency between the parties. Accordingly, except as expressly authorised under this Agreement neither party has authority to pledge the credit of or make any representation or give any authority to contract on behalf of another party. No Supplier Staff shall be construed as being an employee of SCB by virtue only of this Agreement or the performance of the Supplier's obligations under this Agreement.
