6    Transition
6.1    The Supplier Companies shall perform the transition Services set out in Schedule 3.
6.2    The Supplier Companies shall take all reasonably commercial efforts to ensure that each milestone set out in Schedule 3 and the PBB Network Implementation Plan is achieved by the Supplier Companies by the date specified in Schedule 3 or the PBB Network Implementation Plan for that milestone.

6.3    Service Credits: Clauses 6.4 to 6.8 will only apply if Schedule 5 specifies the payment of Service Credits where a specific obligation is not performed by the Supplier Companies by the scheduled CRFS Date.
6.4    Where the Supplier Companies have not completed their obligations under Schedule 3 or the PBB Network Implementation Plan by the CRFS Date, the Supplier will pay SCB Service Credits as provided for in this clause. However, SCB may waive any such requirement, and the Supplier may make submissions to SCB setting out the reasons why the specific obligations were not completed by the scheduled milestone date.
6.5    The Service Credits shall be as set out in Schedule 5.

6.6    Where Schedule 5 provides for the payment of Service Credits, the Supplier must pay the Service Credits from the scheduled CRFS Date until:

whichever first occurs (but subject to any maximum number of days specified in Schedule 5).
6.7    The Service Credits shall be applied as set out Schedule 6 (Charges).
6.8    Any Service Credits paid under this clause 6 do not cap or limit the SCB Contracting Entities’ ability to claim damages generally for other events in relation to which the Supplier Companies have liability to the SCB Contracting Entities.
7    Services
7.1    Services: On and from the Service Commencement Date, the Supplier Companies shall perform all of the, or as the context requires, all applicable obligations of the Supplier Companies under this Agreement, including as set out or referred to in Schedules 4, 7, and 8 for all members of the SCB Group.

Technology standards
The Supplier Companies shall comply with the provisions of Schedule 12.
Service Levels
The Supplier Companies shall perform the Services so as to meet or exceed the Service Levels as set out in Schedule 5.
If the Supplier Companies fail to achieve any Service Level or there is otherwise a Service failure, the Supplier and the relevant Supplier Companies shall promptly:
(a)    investigate the underlying causes of the failure and preserve any data indicating the cause of the failure;
(b)    take whatever commercially reasonable actions are necessary to minimise the impact of the failure and to prevent it from recurring;

Changes
No change shall be incorporated into this Agreement except in accordance with the provisions of this clause 11 and the Schedules referenced in it.
Where SCB wishes to implement a technical change with no commercial or contractual impact to the Network, or where the Supplier wishes or is required to make a technical change to the Network which relates to or impacts on the performance and observance of the Services, such technical change shall be categorised as a service change (Service Change).
Where a member of the SCB Group wishes to:
(a)    incorporate a new service (being one which is similar in nature to any of the Services and/or the supply of which would be consistent with the then current terms of this Agreement); or
(b)    incorporate a change to an existing Service, including any increase or decrease in volume of an existing Service or any enhancement or other
change to the Services or Service Levels which will increase or decrease the Charges payable; or
(c) incorporate a change to the Service Levels which may or may not affect the Charges,
such change shall be categorised as a request for service (Request for Service).
11.4    Where the Supplier is required to change its approach to the performance and observance of the Services due to a change to Relevant Law, such change shall be categorised as a Request for Service. In the circumstances described in this clause, the Supplier shall, in its response to any Request for Service raised by SCB or due to a change to Relevant Law, indicate any increase or decrease in its costs arising as a direct result of the applicable circumstances. In the circumstances described in this clause, the costs of such change shall be met by the SCB Contracting Entities if and to the extent that:
(a)    the changes result in incremental costs and expenses for the Supplier Companies; and
(b)    the Supplier cannot mitigate such costs and expenses (including for the purposes of this provision the SCB Contracting Entities where the change to the Relevant Law impacts the Services to be provided to such SCB Contracting Entity).
For the avoidance of doubt, the relevant SCB Contracting Entities shall pay the relevant Charges for any increased bandwidth and CPE requirements arising from a change.
11.5    The technical changes required to implement any Request for Service shall be processed as Service Changes.
11.6    Where either Party wishes to incorporate a commercial change to this Agreement or where a change cannot wholly be processed as one or more Requests for Service and/or one or more Service Changes, such change shall be categorised as a contract variation. As appropriate, contract variations shall be implemented in whole or in part by processing Requests for Service and/or Service Changes.
11.7    Once a proposed change has been categorised, it shall be processed as follows:
(a)    if the change is categorised as a Service Change, then the procedures set out in Schedule 4 shall be followed;
(b)    if the change is categorised as a Request for Service, then the procedures set out in Schedule 15 shall be followed; or
(c)    if the Change is categorised as a contract variation, then the procedures set out in Schedule 14 shall be followed.
11.8    Where either Party feels that a change has been categorised incorrectly, the matter shall be resolved through the governance process in Schedule 13.
12 Charges
12.1 In consideration of the performance of the Services, each of the SCB Contracting Entities shall pay the relevant Supplier Company the Charges set out and calculated in accordance with Schedule 6 and the relevant Order Form.
12.2    The Charges shall be invoiced to the relevant SCB Contracting Entities by the relevant Supplier Company, as contemplated in, at the times and in the manner specified in Schedule 6.
12.3    SCB or an Other SCB Entity may deduct or set-off from any payment due from it under a valid invoice, or otherwise payable by SCB or the relevant Other SCB Entity, any sums or amounts owed by the Supplier Companies to it under this Agreement.
13    Governance
The Supplier Companies shall comply with the provisions of Schedule 13.
14    Supplier personnel
14.1    The Supplier Companies shall ensure that all Staff are suitably experienced, qualified, trained and skilled to the level expected of a specialist telecommunications professional providing services similar to the Services to customers of the same nature as the SCB Group, and that Staff act at all times in a professional manner.
14.2    The Supplier Companies shall ensure that their Staff comply with all applicable SCB policies and procedures relating to security and health and safety when on SCB Premises.
14.3    The Supplier Companies shall ensure that they, and each of their subcontractors, comply with all obligations relating to payments of taxes and levies imposed on an employer, which arise in respect of any amounts paid by the Supplier Companies or their subcontractors to Staff, and that they comply with all requirements imposed on an employer under Relevant Law in relation to its employees and its workforce generally, and to keep records, lodge returns and provide information in relation to such obligations.
14.4    The Supplier Companies warrant, represent and undertake that if any of their Staff is subject to immigration control:
(a)    the relevant Staff have valid and subsisting leave to enter or remain in the country where the Services are to be provided; and
(b)    the relevant Staff are not subject to any conditions (in relation to such leave) which may affect the Supplier Companies’ obligations under this Agreement.
15    Subcontracting
15.1    No Supplier Company shall appoint a Dedicated Subcontractor except with the prior written consent of SCB. For the avoidance of doubt, any actual or proposed appointment of any member of the Supplier Group (other than the Other Supplier Entities) as a subcontractor shall be subject to the provisions of this clause 15. SCB may from time to time request from Supplier information about other subcontractors or subcontractors of the Dedicated Subcontractors and to the extent reasonably possible Supplier shall provide such information.
15.2    SCB has as at the Effective Date consented to the Supplier Companies appointing each of the Dedicated Subcontractors specified in Schedule 11 to supply the goods or provide the services specified in that Schedule. Schedule 11 shall be updated to reflect any additional Dedicated Subcontractors to which SCB has consented during the Term.
15.3    The Supplier shall give SCB reasonable notice of any request for SCB's consent to appoint a Dedicated Subcontractor. Such notice shall specify the elements of the
Services affected, the scope of the proposed appointment and the identity of the proposed Dedicated Subcontractor. Supplier shall be deemed to have provided such notice if the above-mentioned information is provided in the Order Form for the Services affected. SCB shall respond as soon as reasonably practicable to any such requests.
15.4    In whatever circumstances a Supplier Company appoints a subcontractor in respect of any of its obligations to perform the Services, the Supplier Company shall not be relieved of any of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement by appointing any subcontractor, and the Supplier Company shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any subcontractor or any Staff as fully as if they were the acts or omissions of the Supplier Company in relations to those obligations of the Supplier Company under this Agreement performed by such subcontractor.
15.5    Where:
(a)    in SCB's reasonable opinion there are or may be Relevant Laws which require that any of the obligations of a Supplier Company which have been subcontracted to a Dedicated Subcontractor should cease to be subcontracted; or
(b)    in SCB's reasonable opinion any of the obligations of a Supplier Company which have been subcontracted to a Dedicated Subcontractor are not being performed in accordance with this Agreement,
then SCB may, subject to clause 11, require that the Supplier Company ceases using the Dedicated Subcontractor, and the Supplier Company shall as soon as possible (and in any event within 30 days) either appoint a different Dedicated Subcontractor subject to clause 15.1, or perform the relevant obligations itself where possible.
16 SCB Premises
16.11    The SCB Contracting Entities shall provide the Supplier Companies with access to the SCB Premises (including access to necessary facilities and utilities at the SCB Premises) both during and, provided reasonable notice has been given by the Supplier to SCB, outside normal working hours for the purposes of fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement.
16.12    The SCB Contracting Entities shall maintain the SCB Premises in good operating condition for the Supplier Assets (for example, in accordance with the relevant Supplier Asset manufacturers’ specifications as to temperature, vibration and humidity).
16.13    The SCB Contracting Entities shall obtain any permissions and consents from third parties that are necessary to allow the Supplier Companies to access the SCB Premises (for example, any permissions to cross real property to access the SCB Premises).

16.15    SCB shall advise the Supplier of relevant health and safety at work rules in operation at the SCB Premises to which Staff are provided access in accordance with this Agreement. Each Supplier Company shall (and shall ensure that its Staff shall) comply with the SCB policies and procedures and with all rules, regulations and policies of which any SCB Contracting Entity has made any Supplier Company aware relating to access to and presence on the SCB Premises.
 
8M-8S 'S'
16.16    Each Supplier Company shall be responsible for all acts and/or omissions of Staff whilst on the SCB Premises (whether in the normal course of business or not).
16.17    Any SCB Contracting Entity may, at any time and for any period and without providing any reason, refuse a Supplier Company or its Staff access to SCB Premises or request their removal from the SCB Premises. Where any SCB Contracting Entity exercises its rights under this clause 16.17 without cause and merely for its convenience, SCB shall compensate the Supplier for its reasonable demonstrable costs directly related to this Agreement and necessarily incurred as a result of the refusal to provide access (subject to the Supplier's duty to mitigate such costs).
16.18    If a SCB Contracting Entity exercises its rights under clause 16.17 other than in a situation where there has been a default or an alleged default by a Supplier Company or its Staff or where the SCB Contracting Entity otherwise has good cause for exercising such rights then, if and to the extent that a Supplier Company is prevented from performing its obligations under this Agreement as a result of such exercise, the Supplier Company shall not be liable for any resulting breach of this Agreement to the extent directly caused by the exercise, provided always that the Supplier Company promptly notifies SCB of the relevant circumstances and does everything that is commercially reasonably possible to perform the Services.
16.19    Except in the case of emergency repairs, the Supplier Companies will notify the relevant SCB Contracting Entity at least seven (7) days prior to any regularly scheduled maintenance that will require access to the SCB Premises.
