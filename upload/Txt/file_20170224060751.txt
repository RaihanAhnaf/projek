(a) shall not be included when calculating Supplier's limit on its liability set out in Clause 32; and

For clarification, any award of damages in respect of a failure by the Supplier to meet the Service Levels should not take into account any Service Credits already credited or paid by the Supplier to SCB in respect of the failure.

Save to the extent SCB has failed to meet timeframes set out in Schedule 11 (Performance Management), failure by SCB to so notify Supplier shall not in any way affect the rights or remedies of SCB or the accrual of Service Credits.

(f) meet at least once quarterly to discuss the potential improvements and refinements to the Services and advise SCB as to what new or improved technologies and/or processes could be implemented in relation to the Services.

(c) if Supplier reasonably believes that the grant of the licence described in Clause 28.7(b) from a Third Party is not available and that it is not commercially appropriate to negotiate for such rights from the Third Party, as such Third Party would never assign ownership of, or grant a licence equivalent to ownership rights of the relevant New Materials to SCB, then Supplier shall use all reasonable efforts to procure the grant of a licence to SCB and SCB Contracting Parties that has the widest possible rights available and appropriate for the requirements of SCB; and
(d) any licence granted by Supplier or Supplier Contracting Parties shall be royalty free. However, if any royalty or fee needs to be paid to a Third Party in order for a licence under Clause 28.7(b) or 28.7(c) to be granted or procured, then Supplier shall obtain SCB's prior written consent before entering into such a licence.
28.8 SCB hereby grants to Supplier a non-exclusive, royalty free licence for the Term to use any New Material solely for the purpose of providing the Services and/or Deliverables in accordance with the Agreement, and otherwise for fulfilling its obligations in accordance with the Agreement or the written directions of SCB. Subject to the right of Supplier and each Supplier Contracting Party to sub-licence to the Approved Sub-Contractors the use of any New Materials strictly for the purposes of providing the Services and/or Deliverables in accordance with the Agreement, the rights granted under this Clause 28.8 are personal to Supplier and each Supplier Contracting Party, and Supplier and each Supplier Contracting Party has no right to sub-licence, assign or transfer any of its rights herein without the prior written consent of SCB. For the avoidance of doubt, the Approved Sub-Contractors shall not be entitled to further sub-licence the use of the New Materials to any Third Party except as may be reasonably required to fulfil their obligations in relation to the Services, and the Approved Sub-Contractors shall only have the right to use the New Materials strictly for the purposes of providing their respective services and/or deliverables in relation to the Agreement in accordance with their contract with Supplier, Supplier Contracting Party or SCB, as applicable.
28.9 The licence granted pursuant to Clause 28.8 will terminate automatically without notice upon the termination or expiry of the Agreement and Supplier shall and shall procure that each of Supplier Contracting Parties, Approved Sub-Contractors and their Staff shall promptly following termination of the licence:
(a) immediately cease all use of the New Materials;
(b) provide to SCB copies of all New Materials which it has in its possession or control; and
28.10

28.11

28.12

28.13

28.14

(c) unless otherwise specified in writing by SCB, permanently delete all copies in whatsoever form of the New Materials in its possession and control, and, if requested by SCB, certify that such deletion has occurred.
Where any Intellectual Property Rights in New Materials have yet to come into existence, such rights shall vest in SCB (or such person or persons as SCB may, on a case by case basis, nominate in writing prior to such assignment) as immediately upon so coming into existence.
Pursuant to Clause 28.6, at SCB's request, Supplier shall (and shall procure that relevant third parties including its Staff shall) do all such further acts and execute all such further documents and instruments as may be necessary or desirable in order to confirm title in the Intellectual Property Rights in SCB (as the case may be or its nominated person(s)) or assist (or such nominated person(s)) in applying for registration or similar protection in any part of the world of the Intellectual Property Rights.
Supplier will not and shall procure that any third parties involved in the development of the Intellectual Property Rights in any tangible or intangible deliverables produced by or arising from the delivery of the Services to SCB, do not (whether by act or omission) do anything during the Term or at any times thereafter to affect or imperil the validity of any Intellectual Property Rights obtained, applied for or to be applied for by SCB or its nominee.
Supplier Materials
Subject to the licence granted in Clause 28.14, all Intellectual Property Rights in any Supplier Materials shall remain in Supplier or its licensors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ownership of any physical media on which any Supplier Materials are delivered to SCB shall vest in SCB or their nominee.
Supplier hereby grants an irrevocable, royalty free (save for the Charges), non-exclusive licence to access and use Supplier Materials to SCB for itself and for the benefit of (i) all members of SCB Group; (ii) any Divested Entities subject to Clause 22 (Divested Entities); (iii) SCB Service Providers; (iv) any member of SCB Group engaging a Replacement Service Provider (the “Authorised Users”), during the Term, to:
(a) use the Supplier Materials;
(b) make copies of any Documentation accompanying or generated from such Supplier Materials;
(c) use and store data within any database comprised in such Supplier Materials, and to extract and re-utilise data there from and amend or merge the data or database; and
(d) use software owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Supplier which forms part of the Supplier Materials or which is used for the provision of the Services or for any service which any member of SCB Group may procure which interfaces with or is dependent on this Service,
in connection with receiving the benefit of the Services, performing any of SCB's obligations or exercising any of SCB's rights under the Agreement or any relevant Local Agreement.
28.15 Where use of the Supplier Material requires SCB and/or the Authorised Users to use third party Material, Supplier shall arrange for the grant of an irrevocable, royalty free (save for the Charges), non-exclusive licence or sub-licence to SCB for itself and for the benefit of the Authorised Users to access and use such third party Material for the purposes set out in Clause 28.14, during the Term.
28.16 The Authorised Users shall, at no additional cost, be entitled to use Supplier Materials subject to any restrictions agreed upon by the Parties in writing on the number of, or locations of, users and may access and use the same for business or contingency purposes.
28.17 If Supplier is unable (despite using all reasonable endeavours) to secure a licence in respect of Supplier Materials upon the minimum licensing terms set out in this Clause 28 (Intellectual Property) and the Supplier is unable to offer an alternative solution that is acceptable to SCB having been given a reasonable period of time to do so, Supplier must promptly notify SCB and SCB may immediately terminate the affected portion of the Agreement without liability or payment of termination charges or costs.
Data
28.18 All Data, or any compilation comprising the Data, and any Intellectual Property Rights subsisting or arising from such, belong to SCB and Supplier hereby assigns to SCB immediately upon their creation or their acquisition by Supplier any such rights that may from time to time vest in Supplier, Supplier Group member, a subcontractor or any of its respective Staff.
28.19 Supplier shall not use the Data, except in so far as is required for it to provide the Services and/or Deliverables in accordance with the Agreement, and strictly in accordance with
Clauses 38 (Confidentiality) and 39 (SCB Group Confidential Information Protection and Security).
Warranties and Indemnities in relation to Intellectual Property Rights
28.20 Supplier warrants, represents and undertakes to SCB that:
(a) the performance or the provision by Supplier or the proper use by SCB or a member of the SCB Group of the Services, Deliverables or the Supplier Material or New Materials, or any part thereof, will not in any way constitute an infringement or other violation of any Intellectual Property Right of or duty of confidentiality owed to any third party or cause any member of SCB Group or any of its customer or Staff thereof to infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; and
(b) Supplier owns or has obtained valid licences for all Intellectual Property Rights which are necessary to the performance of any of Services or provision of Deliverables under the Agreement.
28.21 Supplier shall indemnify the Indemnitees and keep them fully and effectively indemnified (and shall pay such sums to them as would indemnify and keep indemnified each other Indemnitees) against any and all Damages of whatsoever nature incurred by or awarded to the Indemnitees, arising out of a claim or allegation that arises where Supplier is or is alleged to be in breach of any provision of this Clause 28 (Intellectual Property), including infringement or alleged infringement of Intellectual Property Rights of any person, which occurs by reason of:
(a) use by the Indemnitees of any Services, Deliverables or Material supplied or developed by or on behalf of Supplier or Supplier Staff (except to the extent that such use is not permitted by the Agreement); or
(b) any act done by, or on behalf of, or authorised or caused by Supplier or Supplier Staff (other than where acting on an instruction from a duly authorised representative of SCB).
28.22 If a claim of infringement of Intellectual Property Rights is made or threatened by a third party, Supplier shall at its sole expense and cost, with the consent of SCB either:
(a) obtain for the Indemnitees the right to retain the possession of, and to continue the use of, the whole or the relevant part of any infringing or allegedly infringing Material so as to continue the enjoyment of the Services which is the subject of the claim; or
(b) replace or modify any infringing or allegedly infringing Materials or Services in a manner acceptable to SCB so that:

(ii) the infringement or the alleged infringement ceases; and

(c) any other Local Agreement with the same Supplier Contracting Party is terminated by the relevant SCB Contracting Party, and SCB or the SCB Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the termination of one Local Agreement will have an adverse effect on the Supplier's or Supplier Contracting Party's ability to provide Services under another Local Agreement (and in which case, the adversely affected Local Agreement may be terminated only if the SCB Contracting Party has given the Supplier Contracting Party reasonable time to remedy such adverse effect).

(b) the Supplier commits an act or omission that materially damages or is reasonably likely to materially damage, the reputation or brand of a SCB Group member. The Parties agree, by way of example, that such an act or omission that would materially damage the reputation or brand of a member of the SCB Group includes criminal acts (including fraud) or criminal investigations in respect of, any person in the Supplier's senior management or a breach of SCB's “Code of Conduct”;

34.10 SCB may, for the purpose of determining whether to give its consent under this Clause 34 (Termination), request that Supplier supply information and/or documentation about an entity or entities with whom Supplier may, by reason of takeover, merger or acquisition, become associated with, in order that SCB may satisfy itself as to appropriate compliance with applicable anti-money laundering regulations.
Termination with cause by Supplier

(a) carry out the Screening Procedures;
(b) supply SCB with the results of such Screening Procedures; and
(c) pass to SCB any information, including Personal Data, relating to a Non-Employed Worker which was gathered as a consequence of the Screening Procedures.
