d) Problem Management
Problem Management helps to minimize the effects of incidents caused by errors in the operation and technology infrastructure/ environment and to prevent reoccurrences by enabling to identify the root cause for one or more incidents, implement workarounds, identify known errors, and provide


permanent solutions. Over a period, this leads to a reduced volume of incidents as well as saved time and resources.
An effective Problem Management system/ processes should:
 Identify, document, track, resolve errors and prevent reoccurrences in operation and technology infrastructure/ environment.
 Record root caused and resolution to make them available to affected user groups.
 Find opportunities for improvements and make the necessary tools easily accessible.
 React to issues related to incidents.
 Proactively resolve issues before incidents occur.
Problem Management is to prevent problems and resulting incidents, eliminates recurring incidents and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Problem Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. Incident and Problem Management are separate processes although they are closely linked. Incident deals with the restoration of service to users or business, whereas problem is concerned with identifying, removing the causes of incidents and preventive measures.
Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the resolution to related problems. It is also responsible for ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the appropriate control procedures, especially Change Management and Release Management.
Problem Management also maintains information about problems and the appropriate workarounds and resolution, which helps to reduce number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect, Problem Management has a strong interface with Knowledge Management.
Problem Management provides improved service quality and reliability. The number of recurring incidents should decrease as you increase the number of permanent solutions. As your Problem Management system matures, the amount of elapsed time in the find-to-fix ratio should decrease as well.
The Problem Management processes can be divided into sub-processes as below diagrams.
