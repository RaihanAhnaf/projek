General
Either partymay withhold its agreement to any Change.
There shall be no presumption that the obligations undertaken by either party in connection with the Agreement are in any way changed until an amendment has been effected in writing signed by Authorised Representatives.
No amendments to the Agreement shall be valid and no Change shall be effective unless and until they have been agreed in writing by the Authorised Representative of each party.
Procedure
SCB and the Supplier shall discuss any Change proposed by either party and such discussion shall result in either:
a) agreement in writing not to proceed further with the Change;
b) a written request for a Change by SCB;
c) a recommendation for a Change by the Supplier.
Where a written request for a Change is received from SCB, the Supplier shall, unless otherwise agreed, submit a Modification Note to SCB within fifteen (15) days (or such other time as the parties may agree in writing) containing the information set out in Part 2 of this Schedule and any other relevant information.
A recommendation for a Change by the Supplier shall be submitted as a Modification
Note at the time of such recommendation.
For each Modification Note submitted SCB shall, within the period of the validity of the Modification Note:
a)    allocate a sequential number to the Modification Note;
b) evaluate the Modification Note and either:
c)    request further information, which the Supplier shall promptly provide; or
d)    discuss the terms of the Modification Note with the Supplier and request
amendments thereto; or
e) approve the Modification Note, as submitted by the Supplier or as amended pursuant to (ii) above; or
f) reject the Modification Note.


2.5 SCB shall notify the Supplier of its approval or rejection of the Modification Note by notice in writing to the Supplier. No such notice shall be valid unless signed by a duly authorised officer of SCB.
2.6 If SCB and the Supplier agree a Change and the relevant Modification Note then signature of the Modification Note and any supplement or amendment thereto by
both parties shall constitute a formal amendment to the Agreement to the extent only specified in the Modification Note and any such supplement or amendment.
2.7 Any charges specified in a Modification Note shall, unless expressly stated otherwise in the Modification Note, be the maximum cost of the Change.
