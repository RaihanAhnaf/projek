Schedule 6 Volume Verification
1 Purpose
The purpose of this Schedule is to provide the instructions to obtain a statistics report on a daily basis, such that said daily statistics figures may be compiled into a monthly report to be delivered to the Supplier. The procedures and instructions provided herein assume a level of IT proficiency with command shells and basic file copy/move operations of the financial institution's chosen operating system.
Any further details of the FircoSoft filter engine component may be obtained directly from the user manual.
2 Details
The procedures may be split into two sections, namely the "daily" procedure, and the "monthly" procedure. Any automation on the part of the financial institution is up to the financial institution and is out of scope of this Schedule.
The commands herein are based off version 4.4 of the FircoSoft filter engine, and should be, but is not guaranteed to be, forward-compatible with future versions. The commands could be updated and could differ for each version of the FircoSoft filter engine.
2.1 Daily Statistics
As part of the daily procedure, the following commands should be run at 2359HRS:
 FOFSTAT-FILEOUT=YYYYMMDD-FOFSTAT-OUT.TXT  FOFSTAT-SUM-FILEOUT=YYYYMMDD-FOFSTAT-SUM-OUT.TXT
The following provides the break-down of the command and parameters:
 FOFSTAT
o the actual executable to be run
o must be run from the path where the FircoSoft filter engine has been installed to
 -SUM
o Display sum of days information
 -FILEOUT
o the actual output file name, whereby" YYYYMMDD" should be the four-digit year, followed by a 2-digit month, followed by a 2-digit date
The above process could be executed by a script. All the daily produced file(s) should be safe-stored and accumulated for monthly reporting.
2.2 Monthly Reporting
Simply compress the past month's stored YYYYMMDD-FOFSTAT-OUT.TXT files and send them to support@fircosoft.com.
In addition of the reporting the following lines from the FOF.log file are of interest:
FOFSERV 2012/04/13 10:42:12 -1- *** Licensed to: STANDARD CHARTERED FOFSERV 2012/04/13 10:42:12 -1- *** Expiration: 20131206
If the expiration date of the licence is approaching signal it to you FircoSoft contact in order to obtain a renewed licence.
If the usage seen in the document is reaching the limit from the licence, please contact FircoSoft to obtain to acquire licence which allows more usage.

Assume quarterly scores for the year are QTR 1 =3.90, QTR 2 = 2.20, QTR 3 = 2.20 & QTR 4 =5. Average score for the year of Subscription = 3.325. Therefore assuming yearly Subscription amount = USD 726,000 the resultant additional amount due to Supplier = +10% of USD 726,000 = USD 72,600.

Assume quarterly scores for the year are QTR 1 = -2.30, QTR 2 =-3.0, QTR 3 = -3.0 & QTR 4 =-2.30 Average score for the year of Subscription = -2.65. Therefore assuming yearly Subscription amount = USD 726,000 the resultant additional amount due to Supplier 10% of USD 726,000 = USD-72,600 i.e. Supplier needs to refund SCB USD72,600.1139
Refund Mechanism
For refunds due to SCB as a result of this scorecard, (a) the monies should be set off against future payments (not restricted to payments for this Service); and (b) in the eve nt that there is no future payment, i.e. contract has been terminated, Supplier would have to refund the monies back to SCB in cash within 30 days.
