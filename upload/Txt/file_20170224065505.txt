(approved as part of the change control procedures) within the agreed time frames indicated by the regulatory bodies. Following the implementation of the change control procedures, Supplier must implement any systems changes necessary to meet these requirements and allow reasonable inspection of its services/premises used to provide the Services from time to time if legally required by such regulatory bodies.
