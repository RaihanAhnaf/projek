Data Conversion
Preparation of Data Conversion Specification
This would involve mapping the old data definitions to the new data model. This also defines the data translation and enrichment specifications. This includes definition of default values of extended attributes as well as requirements for extended attributes that will need manual inputs in the new database. Data integrity criteria for Integrity checks, validity checks, control totals & checksums are also defined here.
Development of Data Conversion Programs
This would involve development of specific programs to translate existing data and upload of data. This may also require development of adhoc reports for data comparison.
Assist to perform Pilot Conversion
This would involve pilot conversion of sample data set using the conversion programs.
Verification of converted data is done by data comparison between the old and new database using programs developed specifically for this purpose. Also, the error log during the sample data set conversion is checked to further refine the conversion programs If
required.
Refinement of Data Conversion Programs
This would involve refinement of data conversion programs using the results of the pilot conversion.

Software Acceptance
There will be a release for each of the software deliverables. For each software deliverable release, SCB will declare the acceptance after successful acceptance tests by signing the SCB's system testing signoff form and issuing a notification of software acceptance to the Supplier. SCB will carry out each acceptance testing with the Supplier's support
Wherever relevant, the Specification for the product, specific configuration of hardware and software wilh which it is intended to operate, and the volumes and response times in accordance with which it is to perform and function must be incorporated.
All acceptance tests will be documented. If the system substantially meets the acceptance tests in all material respects, SCB will notify the Supplier within Mutual Agreed Periods, and the date of notification will be the acceptance date. A severity level will be assigned to each defect found and the Supplier will be notified of such. Any Severity 1 or 2 problems will not be
accepted. While severity level 3-4 may not delay the acceptance of the releases, they will be documented in the acceptance test protocol and the required corrections must make within a period of time to be agreed on between the Supplier and SCB in accordance with the
Acceptance Criteria within this Schedule.
Severity Levels definitions are assigned below:
Severity Level 1
Business Operations are severely impacted (e.g. major line outage) OR outage may cause a run on the Bank, a breach of regulatory requirements, has the potential for a high loss of revenue or risks very adverse publicity for SCB
OR any design flaw and vulnerability that put bank's reputation al risk. For example, security loophole.
Severity Level 2
Business Operations are degraded
Severity Level 3
Low impact on Business Operations (e.g. a component or sub-application of the system fails but has minimum business impact for users)
Severity Level 4
Business Operations are not impacted
Acceptance of Documentation
The documents requiring formal acceptance (i.e. functional specification and technical specification) are known as baseline documents.
All documents requiring acceptance will have been previously reviewed in draft form, In an iterative process of arriving at a content and format that Is mutually agreeable to the Supplier and SCB.
At the point where the Supplier thinks that a given document is ready for formal approval, the document together with the sign off form shall be delivered to SCB.
Versions of a document that has not been formally approved will be marked "draft". On approval by SCB, a document will be marked as Version 2.0. Each version of a document will be given a new version number.
Revisions to other documents may be done as needed, without formal approval. Revisions may be accumulated in a working draft of a document until issuing a new version is warranted.

Provisions relating to liquidated damages
1. SCB will perform all the necessary testing in accordance with the agreed test plans and provide feedback and bugs identified to the Supplier promptly. The Supplier will immediately take action to fix all the Severity Level 1 and 2 problems and provide new release to SCB for its further testing. SCB targets where practical to complete all tests 1 week before the Completion Date and reserve the last week prior to the Completion Date for re-testing purpose.
2. In the event that the following key Milestones have not been met by the agreed Completion Dates, SCB has a right to claim liquidated damages of HK$10,000 for each day of delay, counted from the agreed commencement date on 13 May 2003 as shown in the above table.

Force Majeure Event.
4. The parties agree that the right to claim liquidated damages under this Clause is a substantial remedy for late completion and is In substitution for any statutory or other right lo claim any other remedy for late completion.
5. SCB shall have the option to elect whether (i) to receive a credit in respect of the accrued liquidated damages against the invoices, or (ii) to receive a payment from the Supplier, or (iii) to receive same amount of professional services in which the professional services is charged at HK$3,000 per day.

Schedule 10
Technical Architecture
Introduction
New Securities Trading System is the replacement of existing Securities Trading system
CATS and CIOS. This new system is designed to retain only the Priority Banking customer. Automated Securities Trading (AST) through Internet will not be provided.
Infrastructure Consideration
lnfocast iTrade System will be used for the trading engine using three-tier architecture :-client, application and the database. iTrade application is ride on Sun UNIX server. lnfocast !Broker is the settlement and back-office module of the system. It is a two-tier application and it runs on Windows 2000 / Windows NT. iTrade and iBroker share the same database to ensure data integrity
Security Consideration
For network security, connection between the Bank and the Broker is protected through the BPEC firewall channel.
For data confidentiality and integrity, Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol was designed with application level encryption. However, using FIX message encryption Is not a common practice and there is no existing client of the Broker that has implemented FIX message encryption. After consulting Group IT Security, FIX encryption is not necessary as long as private leased line is used.
Network Bandwidth Consideration
Private leased line (128K) will be used to link SCB with the Broker. Refer to the lnfocast  /Trade RBroker Bandwidth document which describes the network bandwidth requirement between Serna data center and the client sites.
Application And Network Resilient Consideration
According to business requirement, warm backup is required. For application resilient following is employed :
 A secondary iTrade server with FIX gateway is installed in the production site for application resilient and high availability fail-over
 A dedicated database server is installed in disaster recovery (DR) site. Both the production and DR database servers are connected lo the SAN storage device.
Transaction log of the production database will be stored in the SAN storage device and online synchronized to the SAN storage in the DR site by EMC SRDF (Symmetrix Remote Data Facility)
 A dedicated iTrade server and FIX gateway is installed in DR site. Transaction log from the production FIX gateway will synchronized to the FIX gateway through the SAN storage
 A dedicated iBroker server is installed in DR site
For network resilient, the following is employed :
 Two 128K leased line will be connected from production data center to the primary site of the broker
 One 128K leased line will be connected from DR data center to primary site of the broker
Scenario
Action
When the production database seiver is down
Using front end application seiver, settlement seiver and database seiver in DR site. Transaction will be going through the DR FIX aatewav to the broker
When the front end application seiver is down
Taken up by the secondary application seiver
When the settlement seiver is down
Taken up by the DR settlement seiver
When the oroduction FIX aatewav is down
Taken up by the secondarv FIXjlatewav.
When the primary broker site is down
