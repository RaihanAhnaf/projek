15.3 SCB may recover directly from the Supplier any damages suffered by other members of SCB Grnup who are parties to, and recipients of Services under, a Statement of Work as a result of any failure of the Supplier to comply with the terms of such Statement of Work or, at SCB's election, require that such damages be paid direct to the relevant member of SCB Group. Where SCB has recovered from the Supplier under this clause on behalf of such member of SCB Group, such member may not then attempt to recover damages itself from the Supplier.
15.4 Each Party's total liability to the other Party in respect of any loss arising out of this Agreement or any Statement of Work shall be limited to the lower of the figures produced by the operation of the following two paragraphs.
a) Cap
Each Party's liability to the other Party in respect of breach of contract or breach of duty or fault or negligence or otherwise whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (other than a Statement of Work) and for each Statement of Work hereunder shall be limited in total to £2 million (or, if greater, 200% of the Contract Price under the applicable Statement of Work) to cover claims of any sort whatsoever (excluding interest and costs) arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (or the applicable Statement of Work as the case may be). Where there is more than one recipient of Services under a Statement of Work (including other members of the SCB Group), the Supplier's limit of liability will have to be allocated among such parties. It is agreed that, save where an allocation is expressly stated in the Agreement, such allocation will be entirely a matter for SCB and the other
Parties and there shall be no obligation to inform Supplier of the allocation. If (for whatever reason) no such allocation is agreed, SCB shall not dispute the validity, enforceability or operation of the limit of liability on the ground that no such allocation was agreed.
b) Proportionality
Supplier's liability to SCB (and any others for whom Services are performed) in respect of breach of contract or breach of duty or fault or negligence or otherwise whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any Statement of Work shall be limited to that proportion of the loss or damage (including interest and costs) suffered by SCB (or the relevant member of the SCB Group), which is agreed between Supplier and SCB or ascribed to Supplier by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction allocating proportionate responsibility to Supplier having regard to (a) the contribution to the loss and damage in question of any other person (including any of SCB's directors or employees or another member of the
SCB Group) responsible and/or liable to SCB tor such loss and damage and (b) Supplier's contribution to such loss and damage. This provision shall have no application to any liability (including vicarious liability) for death or personal injury or arising as a result of fraud neither on the Supplier's part nor to any liability which cannot lawfully be excluded or limited.
For the purpose of assessing the contribution to the loss and damage in question of any other person pursuant to the preceding paragraph, it is agreed that no account shall be taken of any limit imposed or agreed on the amount of liability of such person by any agreement (including any settlement agreement) made before or after the loss and damage in question occurred nor shall any account be taken of such person having ceased to be liable or having ceased to exist or being impecunious.
15.5 From time to time Supplier may use the services of partners or staff from other members of the Supplier Network to assist in providing services to SCB. In some cases, this may result in such partners or staff undertaking a significant proportion of the services under this Agreement, and dealing directly with, providing advice and submitting invoices to, SCB and/or members of the SCB Group. When Supplier uses the services of such partners or staff in connection with this Agreement they are deemed to be acting as
Supplier's Staff and the Supplier is liable for their activities as it they were in all respects Supplier's Staff. No member of the Supplier Network (other than the Supplier) assumes any responsibility to SCB in connection with this Agreement.
15.6 SCB agrees that any claim of any sort whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only against Supplier and that no claims in respect of this Agreement will be brought against any other persons involved in the supply of the Services, including against any other member of the Supplier Network or their or the Supplier's Staff.
15.7 The Supplier, each member of the Supplier Network, and each partner or member of staff thereof and each of our partners or members of staff shall have the express benefit of this Clause 15 and shall have the right to rely on and enforce any of its terms.
15.8 For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations in Clauses 15.5 and 15.6 above shall not apply to any liability that may be incurred directly by another member of the Supplier Network (other than the Supplier) to SCB and/or members of the SCB Group under one or more Local Country Agreements.

UK Prudential Regulatory Authority and as set out in Schedule 7 ("the RRP Provisions"), shall apply to that relevant Statement of Work and be complied with. "Critical Services" refers to services that support SCB in performing its critical economic functions and where the sudden or disorderly failure of the service would lead to a disruption in the performance of those critical economic functions by SCB.

Services" by SCB as defined in clause 24.16.1. SCB acknowledges that the deeming of such Services as "Critical Services" by SCB may impact negatively on the Supplier's decision as to whether to submit a response to RFP and/or enter into a Statement of Work with SCB to provide such Services.

The Supplier shall not be required to carry out more than one additional cycle of Acceptance Tests on the
Work Product, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties. If the Work Product fails such further test then such failure is a material breach of this Agreement and sea may elect at its sole and absolute discretion:
(1) to conditionally accept the Work Product or any part thereof. The conditions of acceptance shall be as the parties may reasonably determine. If so agreed by the parties in writing conditional acceptance shall constitute acceptance of the Work Product or the relevant part thereof provided that all the relevant conditions have been met within the period specified by SCB; or
(2) to:

With the exception of "Strategy & Financial Regulation", the Rate Card may not apply to other
complex services, specialist resources or those services that are performed under unique
circumstances and timeframes, (where upon alternative rates will be agreed on a case-by-case basis). The parties will agree between themselves when a service is classed as 'complex'.

Additional discounts
Sole source discount
In the event that the Supplier is awarded an engagement without a competitive bid process the Supplier will apply a 3% discount to the applicable Rate Card. The sole source discount is expected to provide the monetary benefit to SCB of additional time that the Supplier would have otherwise spent on a proposal.
The sole source discount does not apply:
?    automatically for extensions, where discounts will be typically factored into initial pricing based on the expected life of engagements;
?    on a case by case basis, when significant investments have already been made and recognised by the business. The Supplier would expect due consideration of such investments. The Supplier will quantify the time invested and factor this into the pricing proposal for consideration. The Supplier would consider significant investment as greater or equal to 3% of estimated engagement fees. This time may involve, inter-alia, thought leadership, management workshops, and support to develop business cases for particular projects;
?    automatically in the exceptional circumstances where the resource is scarce and/or the Supplier is the only viable choice amongst Big 4 suppliers (the Supplier, PWC, KPMG & Deloitte) for example where third party preferences impact our appointment (e.g. appointment by a regulatory agency);
?    to engagements greater than $1 m.

Schedule 7
Recovery and Resolution Planning
PROVISIONS TO SUSPEND TERMINATION RIGHTS OF THE SUPPLIER PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION
Whereas:
The Supplier acknowledges that SCB or any member of the SCB Group that is party to a Statement of Work under this Agreement may be required by a Resolution Authority (as defined below) under Applicable Law to restructure, amalgamate, reorganise and/or divest all or any part of the business, assets or liabilities (each such action being a "Divestment") of SCB and/or any member of the SCB Group (each a "Restructured Entity'!);
It is agreed as follows:
1. Resolution and Operational Continuity
1.1 "Resolution" means the exercise by any Resolution Authority of Resolution Powers in relation to SCB, and/or any member of the SCB Group that is party to a Statement of Work under this Agreement pursuant to a formal decision by the government, the central bank or a Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction over SCB and/or such member of the SCB Group that SCB and/or such member of the SCB Group is failing or is likely to fail for the purposes of preventing such failure;
"Resolution Authority'' means any resolution authority with Resolution Powers in respect of SCB, and/or any member of the SCB Group that is party to a Statement of Work under this Agreement;
"Resolution Powers" means any power conferred by Applicable Law on any person to initiate, carry forward, administer or enforce Resolution in the jurisdiction relating to (i) SCB and/or (ii) any member of the SCB Group who is party to a relevant Statement of Work under this Agreement (in respect of the UK, currently being the powers conferred under or by virtue of the Banking Act 2009 in respect of the special resolution regime and the Investment Bank Special Administration Regulations 2011);
"Applicable Law" means all national, supranational, federal, state, foreign or provincial and local laws (including case law), legislation, European regulations, statutes, statutory instruments, rules and regulations from government or governmental agencies which have the force of law in effect from time to time with which the parties and any member of the SCB Group who is party to a Statement of Work under the Agreement are required to comply.
1.2    This Clause 1 will apply from the date that Resolution Powers are first exercised, and will
continue for such time as is required by the Resolution Authority (the "Resolution
Period"). The Parties agree to execute an addendum to duly reflect the Services to be provided by the Supplier during the Resolution Period (the "New Addendum"). For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 1 will apply from the date of Resolution for the
Resolution Period, notwithstanding that the New Addendum may not be in place at any time during the Resolution Period.
1.3 Notwithstanding any termination rights under this Agreement, for the purposes of facilitating recovery action, Resolution and post-Resolution restructuring, the Supplier agrees that it shall, from the date of Resolution and for the Resolution Period, or such longer period as the parties may agree to, subject always to full payment of the
Supplier's charges:
(a) continue providing the Services, Supplier Systems (only to the extent such provision is necessary to the Supplier for the Supplier to be able to continue to provide the Services, which shall be assessed by the Supplier) and the Work
Products as identified in any Statement of Work (together the "Critical Services"), or the relevant part thereof, to or for the benefit of the Restructured Entity and permitting the Restructured Entity to use such Critical Services. Where it is for a part of the Critical Services only, the Supplier shall make a fair and equitable apportionment of the agreed charges that would be payable for such part; and
(b) where required by a Resolution, enter into an agreement ("Separate Contract") with the Restructured Entity for the provision of the Critical Services (or the relevant part thereof) to the Restructured Entity for the Resolution Period on the same terms and conditions as contained in this Agreement (as may be amended with the agreement of the parties or where required to comply with any orders or directions of the Resolution Authority); and
(c) except for the applicable termination rights relating to the non-payment of charges by SCB in accordance with the Agreement the Supplier agrees to suspend its right to terminate this Agreement during the Resolution Period. For
the avoidance of doubt, such suspension is in respect of the Supplier's rights of termination only, and during the Resolution Period, the Supplier retains all other rights owed to it under the Agreement and the relevant Statements of Work, including its right to enforce the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Statement of Work for any breach by SCB and/or any member of the SCB Group that is party to a Statement of Work under this Agreement. The parties agree that nothing in this clause shall prevent the Supplier from seeking injunctive relief at any time. SCB and/or the relevant member of the SCB Group agree that time
shall stop running during the Resolution Period for the purposes of limitation.
1.4 SCB acknowledges that the operation of Clause 1.3 above is subject to the Supplier following its normal client take on procedure in respect of the Restructured Entity and being satisfied (acting reasonably) that providing the Services to the Restructured Entity will not contravene applicable law or professional regulations, including audit independence rules.
