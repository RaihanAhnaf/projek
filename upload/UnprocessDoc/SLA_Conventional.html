<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Problem Management helps to minimize the effects of incidents caused by errors in the operation and technology infrastructure/ environment and to prevent reoccurrences by enabling to identify the root&nbsp;cause for one or more incidents, implement workarounds, identify known errors, and provide</span></p><div><img src="SLA_Conventional_files/SLA_Conventional-18.jpg" style="width:487pt;height:66pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font5">permanent solutions. Over a period, this leads to a reduced volume of incidents as well as saved time and resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An effective Problem Management system/ processes should:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Identify, document, track, resolve errors and prevent reoccurrences in operation and technology infrastructure/ environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• Record root caused and resolution to make them available to affected user groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Find opportunities for improvements and make the necessary tools easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> React to issues related to incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Proactively resolve issues before incidents occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management is to prevent problems and resulting incidents, eliminates recurring incidents and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Problem Management is the&nbsp;process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. Incident and Problem Management&nbsp;are separate processes although they are closely linked. Incident deals with the restoration of service&nbsp;to users or business, whereas problem is concerned with identifying, removing the causes of&nbsp;incidents and preventive measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the resolution to related problems. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is </span><span class="font5">also responsible for ensuring that the resolution is&nbsp;implemented through the appropriate control procedures, especially Change Management and&nbsp;Release Management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management also maintains information about problems and the appropriate workarounds and resolution, which helps to reduce number and impact of incidents over time. In this respect,&nbsp;Problem Management has a strong interface with Knowledge Management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management provides improved service quality and reliability. The number of recurring incidents should decrease as you increase the number of permanent solutions. As your Problem&nbsp;Management system matures, the amount of elapsed time in the find-to-fix ratio should decrease as&nbsp;well.</span></p>
