<p><span class="font5">7.17 Undertake a periodic (no less than once every six months) assessment of disaster&nbsp;recovery capabilities for the Print Centres. The objective of this assessment will be to&nbsp;make a point-in-time analysis of the state of Report Production environments and disaster&nbsp;recovery environments, providing better understanding of the impact of incremental&nbsp;technology changes as well as the effectiveness of Service Change Management&nbsp;processes. The assessment of disaster recovery capabilities will target not only to&nbsp;compare Report Production environments and disaster recovery environments and&nbsp;highlight differences, but should also:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(a) analyse recovery options assessing current disaster recovery capabilities against&nbsp;current technology, industry best-practice and known technology trends;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(b) recommend disaster recovery strategy redesign with implementation approaches and&nbsp;roadmaps;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(c) recommend reengineering the Report Production environments to improve disaster&nbsp;recovery capabilities; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(d) assess risks and exposures to risks in the disaster recovery facilities, identify physical&nbsp;weaknesses that could cause a disaster or other serious interruptions, evaluate&nbsp;existing policies and procedures, event control and monitoring, and employee&nbsp;readiness to meet disaster situations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">d) Problem Management</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management helps to minimize the effects of incidents caused by errors in the operation and technology infrastructure/ environment and to prevent reoccurrences by enabling to identify&nbsp;the root cause for one or more incidents, implement workarounds, identify known errors, and&nbsp;provide permanent solutions. Over a period, this leads to a reduced volume of incidents as well as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">saved time and resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An effective Problem Management system/ processes should:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Identify, document, track, resolve errors and prevent reoccurrences in operation and technology infrastructure/ environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Record root caused and resolution to make them available to affected user groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Find opportunities for improvements and make the necessary tools easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> React to issues related to incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>•</sup> Proactively resolve issues before incidents occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management is to prevent problems and resulting incidents, eliminates recurring</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">incidents and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Problem Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. Incident and Problem&nbsp;Management are separate processes although they are closely linked. Incident deals with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">restoration of service to users or business, whereas problem is concerned with identifying, removing the causes of incidents and preventive measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the resolution to related problems. It is also responsible for ensuring that the&nbsp;resolution is implemented through the appropriate control procedures, especially Change&nbsp;Management and Release Management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management also maintains information about problems and the appropriate workarounds and resolution, which helps to reduce number and impact of incidents over time. In&nbsp;this respect, Problem Management has a strong interface with Knowledge Management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Problem Management provides improved service quality and reliability. The number of recurring incidents should decrease as you increase the number of permanent solutions. As your Problem&nbsp;Management system matures, the amount of elapsed time in the find-to-fix ratio should decrease&nbsp;as well.</span></p>
