<p><span class="font4">2.1 In respect of each Non-Employed Worker, the Supplier must follow and apply, and must&nbsp;ensure that its agents and sub-contractors follow and apply, all such screening procedures&nbsp;and checks as are contained in the following SCB Policies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) the SCB &quot;Group Staff Screening Policy (v.2.1)&quot;; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(b) the SCB &quot;Group Staff Screening Procedure (v.1.15)”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(the &quot;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Screening Procedures</span><span class="font4">&quot;) The Supplier acknowledges and agrees that it has received each of the above documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2.2 The Screening Procedures must be completed before the Non-Employed Worker begins&nbsp;providing Services or Deliverables under the Agreement, and Supplier will not deploy NonEmployed Workers who fail to satisfy the Screening Procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2.3 The Supplier shall ensure that it obtains and holds the written consent of all Non-Employed&nbsp;Workers to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) carry out the Screening Procedures;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">2.9 The Supplier will ensure that each Non-Employed Worker undergoes such SCB provided&nbsp;mandatory training as may be required by SCB, unless SCB has granted a written&nbsp;dispensation in respect of that Non-Employed Worker (or a class of Non-Employed&nbsp;Workers, within which that Non-Employed Worker falls). Any such training will be&nbsp;undertaken on reasonable notice, during reasonable hours, and in a manner which does&nbsp;not interfere with the Supplier's delivery of the Services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2.10 SCB may, at any time request the Supplier to repeat the Screening Procedures in respect&nbsp;of any Non-Employed Worker and if such Non-Employed Worker does not fulfill the&nbsp;requirements of the repeated Screening Procedures, SCB may exercise its right of removal&nbsp;under section<a href="#bookmark309"> 2.12 </a>of this Schedule.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark309"></a><span class="font4">2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCB may direct the Supplier to remove as soon as reasonably practicable from the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">2.1 This Schedule (</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Assurance</span><span class="font4">) relates to SCB Assurance Activities and Supplier Assurance&nbsp;Activities in respect of the Supplier including the Supplier's use of computer hardware,&nbsp;software and other resources to deliver the Services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2.2 The Supplier shall by the Service Commencement Date of each Local Agreement establish&nbsp;a Supplier internal assurance team ( </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Supplier Assurance Team </span><span class="font4">) that will conduct ongoing&nbsp;and regular assurance activities as necessary to identify risks, to maintain an effective&nbsp;control environment, to ensure compliance with Laws, to meet the requirements in&nbsp;<a href="#bookmark120">Schedule 9 </a>(Risk Management) and to achieve the objectives in SCB's Risk Management&nbsp;Framework and Operational Risk Framework (the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Supplier Assurance Activities</span><span class="font4">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2.3 The Supplier shall conduct Supplier Assurance Activities on a reasonably frequent and&nbsp;ongoing basis during the Term (and otherwise as reasonably required by SCB) to assess&nbsp;the risk and control environment and compliance with generally accepted standards for the&nbsp;operation of IT to the extent applicable to the delivery of Supplier's obligations unde r this&nbsp;Agreement with specific focus on compliance with:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">3.1 In order to comply with the operating policies and procedures under which SCB operates,&nbsp;Supplier must maintain an effective internal control environment. This will include the&nbsp;operation of Supplier Assurance Team. Supplier must ensure that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) the Supplier Assurance Team staff have suitable skills, qualifications and&nbsp;experience;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(b) the Supplier Assurance Team staff have access to such Supplier Staff,&nbsp;documentation, relevant records and other information required for the purpose of&nbsp;completing the Supplier Assurance Activities; and</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">4.1 In the financial services industry it is common for regulatory bodies to impose new, or&nbsp;changes to existing, regulations or standards which impact the design of control systems&nbsp;and the application of internal control. Should such changes in regulations or standards be&nbsp;specified by the regulatory bodies, SCB must decide whether any consequential change to&nbsp;the Agreement is required.</span></p>

Upon completion of the Change Control&nbsp;process, Supplier will work with SCB to implement any Changes (approved as part of the&nbsp;Change Control process) within the agreed time frames indicated by the regulatory bodies.&nbsp;Following the implementation of the Change Control processes, Supplier must implement&nbsp;any systems or service changes necessary to meet these requirements and allow&nbsp;reasonable inspection of its services/premises used to provide the Services from time to&nbsp;time if legally required by such regulatory bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4.3 SCB must communicate to Supplier in writing such regulatory changes of which it becomes&nbsp;aware and which it requires to be implemented. A written communication, if sent to&nbsp;Supplier notifying Supplier of a regulatory change, shall be deemed to be a notification of a&nbsp;request by SCB for implementation of that regulatory change.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark315"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 Costs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">5.1 The implementation of any Supplier Assurance Activity findings relating to provision of the&nbsp;Services (including but not limited to any computer hardware, computer software,&nbsp;processes or services included within the scope of the Agreement) found by the Supplier&nbsp;Assurance Team will be implemented at Supplier's own cost. Any Supplier Assurance&nbsp;Activity findings requiring changes which alter the scope of the Services will be processed&nbsp;and implemented by the application of the Change Control procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">5.2 The costs of Supplier Assurance Activities must be borne by Supplier.</span></p><h2><a name="bookmark316"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6 External Audits</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">6.1 SCB Assurance Team will, at any time, on reasonable notice and at SCB's cost, also have the right to undertake SCB Assurance Activities of Supplier's provision of the Services as&nbsp;described in this Schedule (</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Audit Policies</span><span class="font4">).

Notwithstanding the notice&nbsp;restrictions contained within this paragraph, should SCB reasonably suspect that there is a&nbsp;material breach of system security (including Clause<a href="#bookmark177"> 39 </a>of the Agreement) then SCB may&nbsp;immediately notify Supplier of the grounds for its suspicion and, upon such notification&nbsp;having been given, SCB will have the right to undertake an immediate SCB Assurance&nbsp;Activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">6.2 Subject always to applicable Laws and confidentiality restrictions by which Supplier is&nbsp;bound, Supplier's provision of the Services may also be subject to periodic audits by SCB's&nbsp;external auditors or regulators and Supplier must procure that where necessary all&nbsp;Approved Subcontractors provide all necessary assistance and co-operation in connection&nbsp;with such audits.</span></p>
